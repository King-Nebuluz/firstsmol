1. **React**: All the `.tsx` files will share the React library for creating the user interface.

2. **Firebase**: The `firebase.ts` service file will export the Firebase configuration object which will be used in the `auth.ts` service file for user authentication. Firebase will also be used in the `Login.tsx`, `SignUp.tsx`, and `Logout.tsx` components for user authentication.

3. **User Schema**: The `auth.ts` service file will use a user schema that includes fields like `email` and `password`. This schema will be used in the `Login.tsx` and `SignUp.tsx` components.

4. **DOM Element IDs**: The `Login.tsx` and `SignUp.tsx` components will share DOM element IDs for form inputs like `email-input` and `password-input`. The `Logout.tsx` component will have a `logout-button` ID.

5. **Auth Functions**: The `auth.ts` service file will export authentication functions like `signIn`, `signUp`, and `signOut`. These functions will be used in the `Login.tsx`, `SignUp.tsx`, and `Logout.tsx` components.

6. **PrivateRoute Component**: The `PrivateRoute.tsx` component will be used in the `App.tsx` file to protect routes that require authentication.

7. **CSS Styles**: The `global.css` file will contain global styles that will be used across all components. Each component will also have its own CSS file for specific styles.

8. **Typescript Types**: The `index.ts` file in the `types` directory will export types that will be used across multiple files.

9. **Environment Variables**: The `.env` file will contain environment variables like the Firebase API key which will be used in the `firebase.ts` service file.

10. **Package.json**: This file will contain the list of dependencies that all files share.

11. **tsconfig.json**: This file will contain the TypeScript configuration that all `.tsx` and `.ts` files share.

12. **.gitignore**: This file will contain the list of files and directories that should be ignored by Git. This is shared across the entire project.
